            For years, this portobello mushroom burger was on the menu at our former restaurant—and I never ever tired of it! I still crave this vegetarian burger, and luckily, Brian loves it too, so we go through spells where we’ll just have it several days in a row. Do you do that too? I like how easy it is to make, perfect for busy nights- and how adaptable it is- easily made vegan. Yes, you can grill the portobello mushrooms, but for ease, I often just bake them in the oven or use the air-fryer. We also have this <a href="./moqueca.html">Moqueca</a>, for something a little different.

            <h3>Portobello Mushroom Burger Ingredients</h3>
            <p>You generally want to use firm white fish for most stews and soups, because they will hold their shape and not disintegrate in the liquid. Here are 10 the best fish (and seafood) to use in soups and stews.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Portobello mushrooms</b>: Use extra large mushrooms with the stems removed. </li>
                <li><b>Red onions</b>: Make quick pickled red onions or roast sliced onions with the mushrooms.</li>
                <li><b>Cheese (optional)</b>: Use provolone, cambozola, sharp cheddar, smoked mozzarella, or vegan cheese. At the restaurant we used cambozola (super tasty!), but I’ve also been loving provolone. Both add good umami flavor and rich, melty texture.</li>
                <li><b>Avocado, tomato, and greens</b>: Add sliced avocado and tomato and a handful of arugula or other greens or microgreens. </li>
                <li><b>Buns</b>: Brioche buns are perfectly sweet and buttery! Or simply use whole wheat buns—also delicious.</li>
                <li><b>Chipotle Mayo</b>: Use the recipe or simply whisk together mayo (or vegan mayo), red wine vinegar (or apple cider), smoked paprika, chipotle powder (or chili powder), and a pinch of salt. </li>
            </ul>
