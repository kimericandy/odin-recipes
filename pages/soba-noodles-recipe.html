            This Easy Soba Noodles recipe gives all that amazing noodle satisfaction along with a huge boost of nutrition from the buckwheat in the soba noodles.  I think I could eat these noodles every day!  There is just something about the texture and gratifying mouth feel of noodle dishes that is so comforting.  I love that soba noodles are such a powerhouse of sustenance, making them a healthy indulgence!

            This stirfry comes together really fast.  Once all of the ingredients are prepped and ready, it takes just minutes to cook.  The sauce is simple and really highlights the flavor of the buckwheat in the soba noodles and enhances the fresh veggies perfectly.

            You can switch out vegetables to whatever you have on hand.  Cutting the veggies in thin strips allows them to cook quickly and makes it easier to get noodles and veggies together in each bite.

            I find this Soba Noodle Stirfry most comforting when served warm but it is also quite delicious at room temperature.  My kids eat the leftovers cold right out of the fridge!
